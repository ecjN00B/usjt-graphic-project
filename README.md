# Graphic Project

This is a graphic software developed in a project of the University of São Judas Tadeu, whose objective is to draw figures from geometric shapes, save them and have the possibility to load an existing project.

## First Phase

The initial phase was based on the Freeman chain code of eight directions.

## Second Phase

The second phase was based on a book¹ and had the initial code provided by Professor Carlos Menezes.

## Third Phase

Studying the contents of the book¹ was made a new interface with several functionalities, being carried out a complete refactoring of the code. See some code screens:
